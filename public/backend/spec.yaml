Kennedy in Monteverde, Rome, they decided to start a band. The band's name was chosen when they had to register for Pulse, a local music contest for emerging bands. While brainstorming, Victoria, who is of Danish descent, was asked by her bandmates to toss out some Danish words, and they agreed on Måneskin (\"moonshine\"), although its meaning is not related to the band itself. Their debut single, \"Chosen\", was released on 24 November 2017 by Sony Music and charted at number 2 on the Italian FIMI Singles Chart. It was included in the extended play of the same title, released in mid December 2017 and mainly consisting of covers previously performed during the X Factor live shows.",

Throughout his childhood he performed at different musical venues in his hometown and there was no doubt in his mind that he would grow up to become a professional musician. A Hawaiian by birth, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue his musical ambitions. Initially he struggled to establish himself as a singer and took to songwriting in order to earn his livelihood.
