## Installation

You can install this plugin via the Packages manager in Atom itself or manually through the terminal

```bash
$ apm install csslint
```

## Usage

CSSLint is by default validating on save (this can be changed in the package settings), you can also execute it by hitting `ctrl-alt-l`.

If you like you can even set it to validate while typing in the package settings.

A global [.csslintrc](https://github.com/ebednarz/csslintrc/blob/master/.csslintrc) config file can be placed in your home folder and used in any project. However you can specify a project .csslintrc config file (found in root folder of project) that takes precedence over the global file.
